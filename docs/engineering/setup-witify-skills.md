## What it does

`setup-witify-skills` teaches one repo how the engineering skills should behave in it — where issues live, what the triage labels are called, and where the domain docs sit — and records those answers as **config** the other skills read.

It writes config, it does not hard-code behaviour. The engineering chain assumes three files under `docs/agents/` exist; this skill is the one-time bootstrap that produces them, discovered from your actual repo (`git remote`, existing labels, existing `CONTEXT.md`) and confirmed with you rather than guessed. It is prompt-driven — explore, present what it found, confirm, then write — not a deterministic scaffold.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/setup-witify-skills` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it **once per repo, before the first use of any other engineering skill**. If [triage](./triage.md), [to-spec](./to-spec.md), or [to-tickets](./to-tickets.md) start guessing where your issues live or applying labels that don't exist, they haven't been set up here yet. Re-run it only to switch issue trackers or start over — day-to-day tweaks are just edits to `docs/agents/*.md`.

## The three decisions

It leads each with a recommended answer you can accept in a word, and skips whatever it can already infer — so most runs are a couple of quick confirmations:

- **Issue tracker** — where work is tracked, so `triage`/`to-spec`/`to-tickets` know whether to call the Linear MCP tools, the ClickUp MCP tools, or write markdown under `.scratch/`. Linear or ClickUp, with local markdown as the backup; for Linear it also records the team/project, for ClickUp the space/list.
- **Triage labels** — asked only if the `triage` skill is installed, and then just: keep the default labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`)? Say no only if your tracker already uses other names, so `triage` applies real ones instead of creating duplicates.
- **Domain docs** — assumed single-context (one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the root), which fits almost every repo; it only raises a multi-context map when it spots monorepo signals.

The output is a set of files under `docs/agents/` — `issue-tracker.md`, `domain.md`, and `triage-labels.md` when `triage` is installed — plus an `## Agent skills` block pointing to them in whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` the repo already uses. On a [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/boost) project the block goes to `.ai/guidelines/witify-skills.md` instead, followed by `php artisan boost:update` — Boost generates `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` and would overwrite a direct edit. Those files are the shared substrate the rest of the toolkit stands on.

## It's working if

- `issue-tracker.md` and `domain.md` land under `docs/agents/` (plus `triage-labels.md` when `triage` is installed), and an `## Agent skills` section appears in your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — via `.ai/guidelines/` on a Boost repo, never a direct edit.
- The tracker config names the real place you work — the right Linear team/project or ClickUp space/list — and the labels match strings that already exist in your tracker.
- Afterwards, `triage` and `to-tickets` act on the right place with the right labels instead of asking or guessing.

## Where it fits

`setup-witify-skills` is a **run-once setup** — the foundation the whole engineering set stands on, not a step you repeat. Its neighbours are the skills that read what it writes: [triage](./triage.md), because it applies the label vocabulary configured here, and [to-spec](./to-spec.md) / [to-tickets](./to-tickets.md), because they publish into the issue tracker configured here. Run it first; everything downstream assumes it has. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [ask-witify](./ask-witify.md) routes you.
